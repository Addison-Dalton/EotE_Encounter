# Edge of the Empire - Encounter
This a project I made to practice with ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It is a web app created to make it easier to set up the initiative order of an encounter in the popular Fantasy Flight Game's Star Wars Role-playing game.

I have an alternative version of the project which uses no backend. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Addison-Dalton/StarWarsEncounters).
